# Alt scale
Alt scale is a mpv shader. A 2 pass scaler, an alternative to mpv's built in scaling.

`altUpscale.glsl` is optimised for and only does upscaling\
`altUpscaleUnsharp.glsl` is optimised for and only does upscaling, also provides unsharp mask\
`altDownscale.glsl` is optimised for and only does downscaling\
`altDownscaleUnsharp.glsl` is optimised for and only does downscaling, also provides unsharp mask\
`altDownscaleGaussian.glsl` is optimised for and only does downscaling, also provides gaussian blur\
`altDownscaleGaussianUnsharp.glsl` is optimised for and only does downscaling, also provides gaussian blur and unsharp mask

## Usage
If you place this shader in the same folder as your `mpv.conf`, you can use it with `glsl-shaders-append="~~/FILE_NAME"`. For an example `glsl-shaders-append="~~/altUpscale.glsl"`.

## Settings

### Scaling

#### Kernel filter (K)
Which kernel filter function to use for calculation of kernel weights.

#### Kernel radius (R)
Kernel radius determines the kernel size, which is (2 * kernel radius) when upscaling or (2 * kernel radius * downscale ratio * antialiasing amount) when downscaling.

#### Antiringing (AR)
Only for upscale. Reduces ringing artifacts.

#### Antialiasing (AA)
Only for downscale. Effectively trades between aliasing and ringing artifacts.

#### Kernel filter parameters (P1) and (P2)
Some kernel filter functions take additional parameters, they are set here.

#### Sigmoidal curve settings (CONTRAST) and (MIDPOINT)
`CONTRAST` is equivalent to mpv's `--sigmoid-slope` and `MIDPOINT` is equivalent to mpv's `--sigmoid-center`.

### Gaussian blur and unsharp mask (Only for gaussian and unsharp versions)
Note unsharp mask works like this, sharpened = original + (original âˆ’ blurred) * amount.

#### Blur spread or amount (SIGMA)
Gaussian blur sigma value, controls the blur intensity and how much it will be spread accros the blur kernel.

#### Blur kernel radius (RADIUS)
Determines how many neighboring pixels will contribute to the blurred value of the center pixel inside the blur kernel.

#### Sharpening amount (AMOUNT) (Only for unsharp versions)
Sharpening amount or strenght.
